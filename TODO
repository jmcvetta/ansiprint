*	Fix writing to /dev/tty [DONE]

*	Fix processing command line options [DONE]

*	Read data from file(s) [DONE]

*	Check to see if file is binary before printing

*	Make sure the commenting of the program, right at the beginning, 
	clearly details what the cmd line options are, &c. [PARTIAL]
	
*	Include an option to print the filename, date, user, etc. at the
	top of the file.. possible use of some other utility for this??

*	Add a '-m' flag to enable printing from Macintosh terminals
	(presumably this means a CR must be printed along with every LF.)
	(The ASCII decimal for CR is 015.)  Probably the thing to do is to
	read only half a bufsize worth of input, since that way even if the
	entire input consists of LF's (and a CR must be added to each one),
	the output still will not surpass bufsize. (i presume the reason one
	might want to use bufsize would be limitations of their terminal 
	device, not the UNIX host system.)
