find out if there are command line arguments

N.B.	The code doesn't look much like this anymore; but I'm not sure
		with such a small project it's at all worth while updating this.



find out if there are command-line arguments
if yes:
	find out if any of them are filenames
	if yes:
		set input_type to file
		record how many files there are, and what their names are
	if not:
		set input_type to stdin
	record such appropriate option values as the others (which will be flags) indicate
if no:
	set input_type to stdin
look at input type:
if stdin:
	process stdin for printing
if file:
	print each file (seperated by cntrl-D's unless specified otherwise)
