Ansiprint

December 30, 2000 Jason R. McVetta

Allows stdin or files specified on the command line to be printed from a
remote terminal using ANSI escape sequences. 

Inspired by the ansiprt.c component of U Wash's PINE (located in the
contrib/utils folder of the pine distribution).

+++++ Addition on Dec 12, 2000: +++

Prevent binary files from being printed.  (Perhaps include a cmd line
option to allow them explicitly.)  [not done; don't know quite how to do
this]

Will print from stdin unless printing files from cmd line is explicitly
specified.
