                                  ANSIPRINT 0.2.0


GENERAL NOTE

This is a partially-functional beta release.  Right now, ansiprint will
accept input only from stdin.  The buffersize and cntrl-D command line
should also work.  However, as far as I know, what does work, works well.


INSTALLATION

This is a very, very simple program, and should compile on any unix box,
and possibly on other stuff too.  You can install it in the usual way:

	$ make
	$ make install
